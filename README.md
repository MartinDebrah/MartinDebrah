### Reflection / Analysis

Through my coursework in CYSE 600, CYSE 608, and CYSE 609, I recognized that preparing for post-quantum cryptography adoption is not just a technical upgrade but a comprehensive governance and risk management challenge. 

In my research, I learned that quantum-resistant algorithms introduce new complexities: larger key sizes affecting performance, new failure points in key management systems, and regulatory uncertainties. While technical fixes are underway (e.g., NIST standardization efforts), a lack of proactive governance frameworks can leave organizations vulnerable during the migration.

Applying concepts from cybersecurity principles (CIA triad and incident response), I evaluated how compromised key infrastructures could escalate incidents if not properly anticipated. From Windows/Linux security coursework, I related how system-level configurations must also adapt (e.g., larger buffer requirements, new cryptographic libraries).

Ultimately, this project taught me that technical expertise must be aligned with governance, risk assessment, compliance planning, and user training to ensure successful PQC adoption. I aim to further research risk modeling specific to quantum threats and develop secure transition strategies for critical infrastructure sectors.
